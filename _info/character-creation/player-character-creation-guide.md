Ready to plan the perfect heist—and discover who you truly are? Use this guide to create your Vaultlight PC, based on [FATE Condensed rules](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/getting-started#create-your-characters).

## 1. Decide Who You Are

Think about your desperate specialist: what drives them? What skills put them on this crew?
Choose an evocative role and background fitting Vaultlight’s gritty, secretive world.
(See the [Archetypes List]({{ '/info/character-creation/character-archetypes' | relative_url }}) for inspiration.)

## 2. Pick Five Aspects

Aspects are phrases that sum up who you are, your strengths, weaknesses, connections, and quirks. Common types:

- **High Concept:** Your archetype or core identity ("Washed-Up Safecracker," "Reluctant Mystic," "Grifter With a Silver Tongue")
- **Trouble:** Your main liability or source of complications ("Old Enemies Everywhere," "Addicted to the Rush")
- **Background/Relationships:** Friends, rivals, debts ("Owes a Favor to the Mob," "Haunted by a Lost Heirloom")
- **Personal Drive/Belief:** Motivations or values ("Nothing Left to Lose," "Everyone Has a Price")
- **Wildcard:** Unique quirks, theme, catchphrase

**Important:**
At least **one Aspect or Stunt** should have a secret tie to the supernatural world—something with a seemingly mundane explanation that would be recontextualized if the supernatural world were revealed (e.g., "Blends Into The Crowd" → "Latent Fae Glamour", "Traumatic Childhood" → "Alien Abductee").

## 3. Choose Skills

Assign your ranked skills based on what your character does best:

- **1 at Great (+4)**
- **2 at Good (+3)**
- **3 at Fair (+2)**
- **4 at Average (+1)**

*Skills should be arranged in a pyramid shape, and future Skill upgrades need to maintain bottom-heaviness.*

## 4. Select Stunts

Each character starts with **three to five Stunts**.
A Stunt is a special trick you can do, usually tied to a Skill (e.g., "Because I’m a Cat Burglar, I can always find an escape route when inside a building"). Stunts can also be tied to unique equipment that your character always has on their person.

*Each stunt after the third reduces your total Refresh by 1.*

**Note:**
At least **one Aspect or Stunt** should have a secret tie to the supernatural world—something with a seemingly mundane explanation that would be recontextualized if the supernatural world were revealed.

## 5. Set Your Refresh

Default **Refresh** is 3. This means you start each session with 3 Fate Points, unless you take extra Stunts (each extra stunt past the third costs 1 Refresh).

## 6. Final Touches

- Flesh out your appearance, habits, notable gear, and quirks.
- Connect at least one Aspect or tie to another crew member—collaboration is encouraged.
- Prepare a short "how did you end up this desperate?" story.

## Quickstart Aspect Example

- **High Concept:** Streetwise Grifter With a Gift for Getting Inside
- **Trouble:** Can't Let Go of Old Scores
- **Relationship:** Trusted By All the Wrong People
- **Supernatural:** Shadows Seem to Move At My Command
- **Wildcard:** Little Details Never Escape Me
