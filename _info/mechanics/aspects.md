# Aspects & Fate Points

## What Are Aspects?

Aspects are short phrases that describe something important about a character, scene, or object.

**Examples:**
- Character: *"Ex-Cop with a Guilty Conscience"*
- Scene: *"Poorly Lit Alleyway"*
- Item: *"Ancient Corrupted Artifact"*

## Using Aspects

### Invoke for Bonus
Spend 1 fate point to get +2 to your roll, or reroll all dice.

### Invoke for Effect
Spend 1 fate point to create a narrative effect based on the aspect.

### Compel for Complications
GM (or player) offers 1 fate point to complicate a situation based on an aspect.
- Accept: Take the fate point and the complication
- Refuse: Pay 1 fate point to avoid

## Fate Point Economy

- **Start each session** with fate points equal to your refresh (usually 3)
- **Earn fate points** when aspects are compelled against you
- **Spend fate points** to invoke aspects for bonuses

## Free Invokes

When you **Create an Advantage** and succeed, you get a free invoke on that aspect (no fate point cost).
