# Stress & Consequences

## Stress

Stress represents superficial harm—close calls, minor injuries, and momentary setbacks.

- **Stress boxes:** Usually 3 (more with high Physique or Will)
- **Clearing stress:** All stress clears at the end of a scene
- **Taking stress:** Mark a box equal to the shifts of harm (or higher)

### Example
You take 3 stress → mark your 3-stress box.
If the 3-stress box is full, mark the 4-stress box instead (if available).

## Consequences

Consequences are lasting conditions that represent serious harm.

### Severity Levels
- **Mild (-2):** Absorbs 2 shifts of harm. Recovers after one scene.
- **Moderate (-4):** Absorbs 4 shifts of harm. Recovers after one session.
- **Severe (-6):** Absorbs 6 shifts of harm. Recovers after one scenario.

### Taking Consequences
When you can't (or won't) absorb harm with stress, take a consequence:
- Write an aspect describing the harm (*"Broken Ribs"*, *"Shaken Confidence"*)
- This aspect can be invoked against you

### Recovering Consequences
- Requires successful Overcome action (usually during downtime)
- Time must pass according to severity

## Being Taken Out

If you can't absorb all harm with stress and consequences, you're **taken out**.
- Attacker narrates what happens to you
- Usually means capture, death, or removal from the scene

## Conceding

Before rolling defense, you can **concede** the conflict:
- You narrate how you lose, but avoid the worst outcome
- Gain a fate point
- Avoid being taken out
