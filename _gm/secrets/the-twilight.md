# The Truth About the Twilight

**Player Knowledge:** The city has been in perpetual twilight for as long as anyone remembers. The sun never fully rises or sets.

**The Truth:** 

## The Event

Approximately 300 years ago, something began to manifest at the edges of reality—an entity or entities that exist in contradiction to material existence. As it approached, reality itself began to fracture.

The city's founding architects (possibly aided by something ancient) created the Twilight as a protective measure—a state of semi-reality that exists between full manifestation and complete oblivion.

## The Thirteen Anchors

Scattered throughout the city are thirteen Anchors, magical-technological constructs that maintain the Twilight state. Each is disguised as something mundane:

1. **The Vaultlight (Central Archive)** – Sealed vault
2. **The Eternal Fountain (Obsidian Plaza)** – Non-functioning fountain
3. **The Silent Bell (Cathedral District)** – Bell tower that never rings
4. **The Stopped Clock (Meridian)** – Clock frozen at midnight
5. *[Others to be revealed]*

## What the Anchors Do

- Create a "bubble" of stable reality within the Twilight
- Prevent the entity from fully manifesting
- Maintain the perpetual twilight state
- Keep the population in a state of "functional oblivion"—aware enough to live but not aware enough to panic

## What Happens If An Anchor Fails

- The Twilight weakens in that area
- Reality becomes more fluid
- The entity's influence increases
- Madness spreads
- Eventually, full manifestation or collapse into void

## The Ethical Dilemma

The Twilight is a prison for the entire city, but it's also protection. The population lives in eternal gloom, but they live. Is it better to:
- Maintain the Twilight and its half-life existence?
- Risk destruction by dismantling the Anchors?
- Seek a third way that may not exist?

## Who Knows

- **The Keepers:** Full knowledge, dedicated to maintaining status quo
- **The Awakened:** Partial knowledge, believe ending Twilight is better
- **City Authority:** Leadership knows, middle ranks suspect, low ranks ignorant
- **The Syndicate:** Suspects something but doesn't understand
- **General Population:** Completely unaware

## The Artifact in Vaultlight

The "artifact" the crew seeks is the Anchor's core—a crystallized fragment of the entity itself, bound and sealed. Removing it will destabilize the Anchor.

Maestra Nyx (the client) believes destroying the Anchors will "free" the city. She's either nihilistically correct or catastrophically wrong.

**GM Note:** Reveal this gradually through clues, NPC hints, and environmental storytelling. The full truth should dawn on players, not be info-dumped.
