# Maestra Nyx

**Player Knowledge:** The client is anonymous, communicates through Marcus Vale

**The Truth:** The client is Maestra Nyx, leader of the Awakened cult.

## Identity

- **Public Face:** Renowned archaeologist and historian at the University
- **Secret Identity:** Leader of the Awakened, a cult seeking to end the Twilight
- **Age:** Late 50s (appears younger due to exposure to Anchor energies)

## Appearance

- Tall, elegant, silver hair in severe bun
- Always wears dark academia aesthetic—long coats, high collars
- Striking grey eyes that seem to reflect no light
- Carries an ornate cane with unusual geometric patterns

## Motivation

Nyx genuinely believes the Twilight is a slow death for humanity—a stasis that prevents growth, evolution, and true existence. She's seen glimpses of what lies beyond and believes it's preferable to the current half-life.

She may be:
- A visionary willing to risk everything for freedom
- A deluded fanatic courting apocalypse
- Partially corrupted by the entity she seeks to release
- All of the above

## The Awakened

Her cult consists of:
- Disillusioned academics who've researched too deeply
- Those who've experienced the entity's influence
- People desperate enough to embrace any change
- A few genuine cultists seeking power

They operate in cells throughout the city, slowly working to destabilize the Anchors.

## Her Plan

1. Hire expendable crews to breach the Anchors
2. Use the retrieved cores to create a "key"
3. Intentionally collapse the Twilight state
4. "Awaken" the city to "true reality"

She doesn't tell her agents the full plan—they think they're just stealing artifacts.

**High Concept:** *Visionary Archaeologist Courting Apocalypse*
**Trouble:** *The Truth is Worth Any Price*

## Quotes

> "We've been dying slowly for three hundred years. Perhaps it's time we lived quickly for one."

> "You call me mad, but I've seen what we're hiding from. It's magnificent."

> "The Twilight was meant to be temporary. We've turned survival into stagnation."

**Revelation Timing:** Players should suspect "the client" has ulterior motives by Session 5, discover Nyx's identity by Session 8, understand her full plan by Session 10.
