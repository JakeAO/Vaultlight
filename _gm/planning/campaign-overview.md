## The Truth About Vaultlight

The Vaultlight is not a vault—it's a seal. Beneath the Central Archive lies one of the thirteen Anchors that maintain the Twilight, preventing something ancient from fully manifesting. The artifact the crew seeks is both key and lock, and retrieving it will have catastrophic consequences.

## Major Factions

### The Keepers (Hidden)
Descendants of those who created the Twilight as protection. They've been watching the vault for generations.

### The Awakened (Cultists)
Believe the Twilight should end, regardless of what comes after. The "client" is one of them.

### The Umbral Syndicate
Genuinely unaware of the vault's true nature but seeking ancient artifacts for profit.

### The City Authority
Know more than they admit but are fractured in their response.

## Key NPCs - Secret Motivations

### Marcus Vale
One of the Keepers, testing whether the crew is worthy of knowing the truth or if they'll trigger catastrophe.

### The Client
Maestra Nyx, leader of the Awakened, who believes freeing what lies beneath will bring "true night" and end the half-existence of the Twilight.

### Detective Winters
Former Keeper who lost faith, now trying to prevent anyone from reaching the vault through legal means.

## Improvisation Notes

- Let players discover clues at their own pace
- The horror should escalate gradually
- Every "success" should come with a cost or complication
- NPCs can shift allegiances based on player actions
- The Twilight itself may respond to the crew's actions

## Themes to Emphasize

- **Noir:** Moral ambiguity, everyone has secrets, nothing is as it seems
- **Heist:** Planning vs. improvisation, teamwork, specialists working together
- **Cosmic Horror:** Insignificance, forbidden knowledge, things beyond understanding
- **Choice:** The crew's decisions matter, even when all choices are bad

**Remember:** The best campaign is responsive. This is a framework, not a script.
