**Type:** Landmark

## Overview
The Penumbra is Vaultlight's most infamous underground casino and neutral ground. It is an opulent, labyrinthine den of smoke, neon, and whispered deals where fortunes are made and lost, and power brokers play for stakes that go far beyond chips and cards.

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** Velvet darkness, neon spill, and smoky haze that never quite lifts.
- **Sound / Mood:** Clinking glass, jazz and synth drifting through the air, laughter masking quiet threats.
- **Textures / Architecture:** Plush velvet, polished brass, mirrored walls, and hidden doors tucked into ornamental panels.

## Notable Locations Within
### Neon Reel Floor
Poker, blackjack, dice, roulette, and house games with odd rules that tilt the odds. Every table has watchers, and cheaters do not last long.

### Private Rooms
Soundproof, heavily guarded suites booked by those who want privacy above all else. Deals here can redraw maps or end careers.

### Bar and Lounge
The best drinks in the city, a rumor for every patron, and a steady exchange of favors behind a practiced smile.

### Back Corridors
Service doors, staff halls, and backroom dealings for those in the know. The routes change, and only trusted staff keep maps.
