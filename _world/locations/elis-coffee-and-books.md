---

**Type:** Landmark - Store

## Overview
Eli's Coffee and Books is a narrow, overstuffed storefront in the [Iron District]({{ '/world/locations/iron-district/' | relative_url }}) that catches workers at both ends of the day: before the morning whistle and after the final shift. It offers simple drip coffee, newspapers, magazines, and a small, rotating selection of used books. Nothing here is polished, but everything is functional enough to keep regulars coming back for one quiet cup before the next grind.

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** Dim, practical lighting and fogged front windows that bead with rain and factory grit.
- **Sound / Mood:** Quiet but lived-in—soft conversation, cash register dings, page turns, and chair scrapes, all muffled by stacks of paper and patched upholstery.
- **Textures / Architecture:** A tiny service counter, overpacked shelves, leaning magazine racks, and mismatched chairs, stools, and tables repaired again and again.

## Notable Locations Within
### The Counter
A cramped service counter where Eli keeps the coffee hot and the line moving. Newspapers and magazines are stacked in uneven piles beside a dented register.

### The Back Nook
A tight corner ringed by used-book shelves and whatever chairs still hold weight. Regulars claim these seats for ten-minute breathers before the next bell.

## Key NPCs
- **Eli:** Owner-operator, practical and patient. Keeps conversations brief, remembers everyone’s usual order, and notices when a regular breaks routine.

## Aspects
- ***"Everyone Nods, Nobody Asks"***
- ***"Held Together by Repairs and Habit"***
