# The Meridian District

**Type:** Commercial/Entertainment District

## Overview

The Meridian District serves as the city's commercial and entertainment hub, though "hub" implies more life than the perpetual twilight allows. Art deco skyscrapers loom over streets lined with jazz clubs, speakeasies, and establishments of questionable legality.

## Atmosphere

- **Lighting:** Neon signs in amber, red, and sickly green pierce the gloom
- **Architecture:** 1930s art deco with inexplicable geometric patterns
- **Sound:** Jazz from clubs, rain on pavement, distant sirens
- **Mood:** Noir desperation with an undercurrent of cosmic unease

## Notable Locations

### The Velvet Nocturne
A jazz club with a reputation for hosting both musicians and deals. Marcus Vale's office is on the second floor.

### The Broken Timepiece
A pawn shop specializing in "unusual acquisitions." The proprietor, Old Chen, knows more than he lets on.

### The Obsidian Plaza
A public square dominated by a massive art deco fountain that hasn't run in years. The statue at its center depicts something that might be human.
