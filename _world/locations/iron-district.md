title: Iron District
topic: Locations
summary: Former foundry quarter turned warehouse maze, ruled by labor by day and the underworld by night.
---

**Type:** District

## Overview
The Iron District once held the city's coal-fueled ironworks, a massive smoking foundry. Today it is a sprawl of multi-story brick warehouses, factories, and blue-collar businesses. By day, the district hums with shifts and shipments; once the whistle blows, workers vanish and the true rulers arrive to move money, favors, and power in the shadow of [The Penumbra]({{ '/world/locations/the-penumbra/' | relative_url }}).

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** Rusted skylights, sodium lamps, and rain-smeared neon reflecting off wet brick.
- **Sound / Mood:** The grind of machinery by day; after dark, the thrum of engines, murmured deals, and distant sirens.
- **Textures / Architecture:** Soot-stained brick, iron beams, corrugated shutters, and faded factory signage.

## Notable Locations Within
### The Penumbra
An infamous underground casino and neutral ground where the city's power brokers gamble with more than money.

### [Montrose Hotel]({{ '/world/locations/montrose-hotel/' | relative_url }})
A historic, discreet hotel favored by out-of-town visitors and operators needing a quiet room and a quiet staff.

### The Foundry Row
A stretch of shuttered plants and active workshops where legitimate production and laundering fronts sit side by side.

### Shiftgate Depot
A freight-yard hub that goes quiet at dusk, leaving the yards open for back-alley exchanges and unmarked deliveries.
