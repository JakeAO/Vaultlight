**Type:** Landmark

## Overview
Benni's is a narrow slice of worn-out hospitality wedged between a dry cleaner and a warehouse at the edge of the Iron District. The diner serves passable food at cheap prices and stays open later than most establishments in Lake City—until around 10pm, when even the desperate are heading home. It's the kind of place where you go when you need a meal and don't care much about the quality, or when you need to meet someone in a space too public to be truly dangerous but too anonymous to draw much attention.

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** Harsh fluorescent lights cast a sickly glow over everything, making the food look even less appealing than it tastes. The windows are perpetually grimy, filtering what little natural light reaches this edge of the district.
- **Sound / Mood:** A constant cacophony fills the cramped space—the clatter of metal utensils on the griddle, the scrape of plates, the tinny blare of radio broadcasts from speakers embedded in each booth. Conversations have to be conducted at near-shouting volume or in close whispers.
- **Textures / Architecture:** The narrow retail space is dominated by worn vinyl booths in various states of disrepair—cracked seats patched with duct tape, stuffing poking through splits in the upholstery. One wall features a small service counter with a handful of stools, their chrome legs spotted with rust. Everything feels sticky to the touch.

## Notable Locations Within
### The Counter
A cramped service counter runs along one side of the diner, barely wide enough for one person to work behind. A few stools line the front, offering a clear view of the griddle and whoever's working it. This is where regulars sit when they want to be left alone—or when they want to keep an eye on everyone who walks through the door.

### The Back Booth
The furthest booth from the entrance, tucked into the rear corner near the restrooms. While it offers no real privacy given the noise and proximity of other diners, it's become the de facto spot for quiet conversations that need the illusion of discretion. The radio speaker in this booth crackles even more than the others.
