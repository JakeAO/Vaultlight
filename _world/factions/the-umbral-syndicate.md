# The Umbral Syndicate

**Type:** Criminal Organization

## Overview

The Umbral Syndicate is the dominant criminal organization in the city, with fingers in every illicit pie—smuggling, protection, information brokering, and darker pursuits. They take their name from the perpetual twilight that shrouds the city, claiming they were "born from the shadows."

## Structure

The Syndicate operates through a cell-based structure, with each cell led by a "Shade"—a lieutenant who reports to the mysterious Council of Shadows. This structure provides deniability and resilience.

## Known Operations

- **Smuggling:** Artifacts, narcotics, and stranger contraband
- **Information Trading:** Secrets are currency
- **Protection Rackets:** Most businesses pay "shadow insurance"
- **Artifact Trafficking:** Particularly interested in pre-city relics

## Known Members

- **Marcus Vale** (?): Rumored connection, unconfirmed
- **The Pale Courier**: A messenger who delivers the Syndicate's ultimatums
- **Shade Corvinus**: Controls operations in the Dockside Quarter

## Reputation

- **Among Criminals:** Respected and feared—betraying them is fatal
- **Among Citizens:** Seen as a necessary evil in an already dark city
- **Among Police:** Some say the Syndicate owns half the force

## Relationship to Vaultlight
