# Session 0: The Assembly

**Date:** TBD
**Location:** The Velvet Nocturne, Meridian District

## Summary

The crew was assembled by Marcus Vale in the private room above his jazz club. Each member arrived with their own motivations, their own secrets, and their own reasons for accepting what Vale called "the impossible job."

## The Briefing

Marcus Vale outlined the job:

> "The Vaultlight sits beneath the old Central Archive building in the Obsidian Quarter. It's been sealed for seventy years, supposedly containing artifacts from before the Twilight—before this perpetual night began. My client wants something specific from inside. Something that shouldn't exist."

## Key Information Revealed

- The Vaultlight has three layers of security: mundane, magitech, and something else
- Previous attempts to breach it have ended in disappearance or madness
- The city's elite are aware of the vault but claim it's empty
- Vale's client remains anonymous, communicating through dead drops
- Payment: Enough to disappear, or enough to matter

## The Crew's Questions

The crew asked about the vault's history, the nature of what they're retrieving, and why Vale chose them specifically. Vale's answers were characteristically evasive:

> "I chose you because you're capable, desperate, or curious—often all three. As for what you're retrieving... you'll know it when you see it. Assuming you see anything at all."

## Next Steps

The crew agreed to:
1. Research the Central Archive building and its history
2. Scout the Obsidian Quarter for access points
3. Acquire specialized equipment for the vault breach
4. Investigate what happened to previous attempts

## Attendees

The session established the core premise and allowed players to establish their characters' relationships and motivations. The noir atmosphere was emphasized, with Vale's jazz club providing the perfect setting for morally ambiguous deals.
