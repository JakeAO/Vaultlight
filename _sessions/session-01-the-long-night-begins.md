## Summary

On a rain-soaked Lake City evening, five broken men each received a cryptic signal. For Heylorn, it arrived as an impossible chess puzzle buried in code. For Evan, woven through the weary pages of newspaper classifieds. For Caleb, hidden in the static of a diner speaker. For Robert, waiting in an envelope on the desk of his locked office. For Clay, pressed into his hand by an old man in a pristine Rolls Royce. Every signal, in its own way, pointed to the same place: **[Montrose Hotel]({{ '/world/locations/montrose-hotel/' | relative_url }})**, and the mysterious number **1108**.

None of them knew the others were coming. None of them fully understood why they couldn't ignore the call—only that something deeper than coincidence had marked them, drawn them toward this night. They arrived separately, making their way through the still-damp streets and into the hotel's lobby: a desperate hacker, a perpetually fired worker, a conspiracy theorist, a worn-out journalist, and a conman searching for a score. But when the elevators opened on the eleventh floor, the five strangers found themselves standing together in the hallway, united by signals they couldn't refuse, facing suite 1108 and whatever awaited beyond its doors.

## Key Scenes

### The Cracker

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="span">Heylorn Olindar receives a mysterious puzzle from an anonymous stranger.</summary>

<div class="details-prose" markdown="1">
The perpetual rain of Lake City's fall season hammered down as Heylorn Olindar stumbled out of [The Penumbra]({{ '/world/locations/the-penumbra/' | relative_url }})—broke and in debt. Again. [Kade Rowe]({{ '/world/npcs/kade-rowe/' | relative_url }}), the Penumbra's public face for floor security, had gently but firmly shown him the door once he'd maxed out his credit. The rain soaked through his coat as he staggered back to the apartment.

Inside, the warmth hit him first. Then the hum.

Dozens of servers sang their electric chorus in his cramped studio. Banks of VCRs, BetaMax players, 8-track decks, cassette machines—tech of every forgotten era wired together in baroque tangles, all feeding into a single glowing display. This was his sanctuary.

With his wallet empty, Heylorn did what he always did: he slid into his chair and let his fingers find the keyboard. The green glow of the monitor would be his sun tonight, just like most nights.

Then came the ping.

An anonymous IP. Another one. That same IP had been pinging him for weeks with insistent invitations to a play-by-wire chess match. Tired of the noise, Heylorn finally relented and joined.

He nearly quit within minutes. Something was wrong with the board. Pawns on the first rank. Bishops on the same color. Impossible positions.

Then it clicked: this wasn't a game. This was a puzzle.

Heylorn shifted into cracker mode, fingers flying across the keyboard. An hour melted away. Two. Then, in a burst of clarity, he cracked it: **1108**.

But what did it mean? An address? A phone number? A room designation? The questions spiraled, unanswered. As dawn crept toward the windows, Heylorn finally admitted defeat for the night.

The puzzle could wait. It wasn't going anywhere.

### The Spotter
<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="span">Evan Miller spots a repeated phrase amongst dozens of newspapers.</summary>
<div class="details-prose" markdown="1">
The factory whistle shrieked and Evan Miller's last shift ended. He joined the tide of workers streaming toward the exit, a termination letter clutched in his hand. Fired. Again. Another job, another failure—he'd lasted nearly two weeks this time, which was almost a record.

The rain hammered the streets as he trudged through the city. His umbrella gave up first, collapsing under a gust of wind. Evan abandoned it in a gutter and kept walking.

[Eli's Coffee and Books]({{ '/world/locations/elis-coffee-and-books/' | relative_url }}) was warm and familiar. He exchanged silent nods with the regulars—the old readers, the late-shift insomniacs, the other drifters—and gathered an armful of newspapers from the front rack. Then he claimed one of the mismatched chairs in the back corner, near a table that was only somewhat cluttered, and got to work.

Hours dissolved into classified sections and personal ads. Evan's eyes tracked across columns of job listings: dishwasher, dock worker, night security, file clerk. He knew most of these gigs already—knew exactly which ones he'd flamed out of, and when. His problem wasn't laziness or incompetence. It was that his anxiety and his difficulty reading people meant he didn't survive social dynamics. A little over a week was his average. Some jobs didn't even make it to one.

He crossed off listing after listing. The evening deepened. Eli dimmed the lights and began closing up. The regulars filed out into the rain.

That's when Evan spotted it.

Two phrases, appearing everywhere. **The Montrose Hotel**. **1108**. Not connected—rarely appearing together—but woven through the papers like a pattern only he was seeing. In headlines. In event announcements. In addresses and phone numbers. In the financial pages and the classifieds and the police blotter.

Over and over and over.

A business mentioned that frequently had to be hiring. Regardless of how mysterious the patterns were, he had to put money enough in his pocket to pay for his next meal.

Evan folded the newspapers and decided: tomorrow afternoon, he'd visit The Montrose Hotel.

### The Saboteur
<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="span">Caleb Rourke hears a pattern in the static of the diner speakers.</summary>
<div class="details-prose" markdown="1">
Caleb Rourke slipped out of the bank's darkened vestibule and into the storm, a small wad of bills clutched in his hand. Not enough to trigger alarms. Just enough to survive another week. He'd done his work clean and quick: disable the security camera, convince the ATM to be generous, disappear into the rain. The coat on his back was secondhand and threadbare, but it was what he was used to. He'd grown up with less.

[Benni's]({{ '/world/locations/bennis/' | relative_url }}) Diner glowed warm against the dark. Caleb shoved through the door as the wind clawed at it, nearly tearing it from his hands. He ordered at the counter—cheap, hot, filling—and claimed a booth in the back corner, away from the handful of other late-night stragglers.

The food arrived steaming. The old speaker mounted above his booth crackled with the day's news and pop songs. Caleb ate slowly, letting the warmth soak into him.

Then the speaker stuttered into static.

His fingers found the napkin on the table, grabbed a pen, and started moving. At first it was idle—just tracking the peaks and valleys of the electronic noise. Then his mind engaged. The static hissed and warbled, and his hand danced across the paper, trying to capture the rhythm.

A minute later, the speaker snapped back to normal programming.

Caleb set down his fork and stared at what he'd written. Lines and scribbles. Patterns within patterns within chaos. He waited for meaning to crystallize, for proof of what he'd always known: that there were forces at work, pulling strings, sending signals that only he could hear.

Then it clicked.

**1108**.

The number appeared in his scratched notes, unmistakable. Not coincidence. Not random. That was a signal. That was *them*—whoever they were—communicating in code, and somehow, impossibly, he'd captured it.

His mind exploded with theories. Which conspiracy would this prove? Which shadow organization used those numbers? The questions spiraled as the storm raged outside and the night deepened around him.

### The Investigator
<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="span">Robert Crane finds an unexpected package inside his locked office.</summary>
<div class="details-prose" markdown="1">
Ice clinked at the bottom of Robert Crane's empty whisky glass. Another empty glass. Another empty bottle. Another day drowning himself in liquor.

He knew every bar in Lake City—every tavern, every speakeasy, every gin joint where a desperate man could find solace or information, sometimes both. Whisky made people talk. It also quieted certain kinds of voices—the ones that came with nightmares, with shrapnel buried too deep for surgery to reach. Wartime scars that no hospital could fix.

Late afternoon found him staggering back toward his office, caught in a brief gap of sunlight between the rain squalls. The building was old brick, the kind that had survived a century of Lake City winters. His "office" was accessible only via the fire escape—really just a large closet cordoned off from its original unit, crammed with boxes and filing cabinets and the empty bottles that had become his constant companions. But every investigator needed an office, even if it was a joke.

He slid the key into the lock, pushed the door open, and pulled the chain to turn on the bare lightbulb swinging overhead. His fingers navigated the maze of stacked files and clutter on autopilot, heading for the desk.

That's when he stopped.

An manila envelope sat on his desk. Centered. Deliberate.

His office was a disaster, but he would have noticed if someone had moved things around. The door had been locked. The frame showed no signs of tampering.

Robert eyed the envelope like it might bite him. He used the end of a pen to manipulate it by the corner, rotating it, examining it from every angle before deciding it wasn't an immediate threat. Then he sliced it open.

Inside: an old, laminated press pass, yellowed by decades. A business card, beautifully embossed, blank except for **Montrose Hotel** letterhead and a number written in careful script: **1108**.

Robert sat back in his chair, turning the card over in his hands. No explanation. No message. Just these two objects, placed on his desk by someone who'd beaten his lock without leaving a trace.

An investigator's job was to chase clues. Someone had just left him a trail.

### The Conman
<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="span">Clay Schofield recieves a mysterious playing card from an old man.</summary>
<div class="details-prose" markdown="1">
The chime above the entrance sang as another car pulled over the pneumatic hose at Little Bear Carwash. Clay Schofield's smile flicked back on—that practiced, customer-service smile that had become his uniform. He greeted the customer, took their order, scrawled the number on their windshield in washable chalk, and sent them through.

Another car. Another customer. Another day as a respectable working man of Lake City.

He hated it.

He missed the thrill of a grift. Missed the big sell. Missed the game—the rush of playing someone, watching them believe the story he was spinning, seeing the moment they bought in. He even missed his wife. Or fiancée. Or ex. The one he should hate but couldn't quite manage it.

The afternoon dragged on. More cars. More chalk numbers. 1100. 1101. 1102. The fall storm had finally broken overnight, sending the desperate and dirty out to reclaim their vehicles. An exceptionally busy day.

As closing time approached and the other carwash attendants finished their closing routines, one final car pulled up to the hose.

A Rolls Royce. Pristine. Legendary.

An old man sat behind the wheel, white hair like spun silk, driving with the careful precision of someone who understood the value of what he commanded. He had the bearing of old money and older secrets.

Clay approached with the conman's smile—the real one, the sharp one that no customer service job could dull. He took the order: **Customer 1108**.

The number made something in him tingle. He scrawled it on the windshield anyway.

When the Rolls emerged from the wash, gleaming, the old man rolled down his window only partway. He folded a crisp hundred-dollar bill around something else—a playing card, ornately illustrated, with a stylized drawing of **The Montrose Hotel** embossed on the back.

He handed it to Clay without a word.

Then he drove away into the setting sun.

Clay stared at what was now in his hand. The money was real. The card was real. And his instincts—the ones that had never steered him wrong when there was a con to be run—were screaming.

He clocked out, caught the first bus heading toward the Iron District, and didn't look back.

### One Fateful Night
<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="span">The five down-on-their-luck men find their ways to The Montrose Hotel.</summary>
<div class="details-prose" markdown="1">
The five men arrived at the Montrose Hotel on the same evening, though not at the same time and not through the same doors.

Evan came first, as afternoon faded to dusk. He slipped through a rear service corridor, hunting for the HR office. But the office had already closed by the time he arrived, and he left with nothing but disappointment. Caleb arrived through the front entrance, muttering to himself, talking in the third person about his investigations, cross-referencing the hotel layout against the patterns in his notes. Heylorn arrived with surgical purpose—he'd already pieced together what the numbers meant, and he knew he needed to reach the suites. He found the elevator controls and disabled the security locks preventing access to the upper floors.

Robert and Clay both gravitated toward the bar. Robert worked the bartender with the ease of a man who'd spent decades extracting information from tight lips. Clay sized up the room, spotted a mark—a drunk tourist ripe for a hustle—and began weaving his particular magic with a fake access pass to a high-stakes gambling ring within the Montrose Hotel, using the embossed playing card as a lure.

Then, almost as if choreographed, all five began their ascent.

Heylorn unlocked the elevator and accessed the suites above without drawing suspicion. Robert took the elevator to the ninth floor, then switched to the fire stairs, climbing toward his destination. Evan and Clay converged without planning at the elevator: they collided, papers scattering. As Evan bent to gather them, Clay glanced down and saw it—**1108**—circled dozens of times in Evan's documents. Evan, collecting his scattered notes, caught the number as Clay attempted to scam him into donating to a fake Lupus Awareness charity, phone number 555-**1108**.

They locked eyes. Both realized, in that moment, that they'd been pulled here by the same signal.

Caleb reached the concierge, [Gordon Hale]({{ '/world/npcs/gordon-hale/' | relative_url }}), still muttering his conspiracy theories, talking about himself in third person—rambling about patterns and conspiracies and forces at work. Gordon heard Caleb mention his own name in the rant, and suddenly understood. He'd been expecting this man. He personally escorted Caleb to the elevator and unlocked it with his staff key.

Then, in a moment of impossible synchronicity, they all arrived at the elevator bank on the eleventh floor within seconds of one another. Doors hissing open. Fire stairs crashing shut. The five strangers materializing like pieces on a board that had been waiting for them to complete the pattern.

They traded suspicious glances. They didn't know each other. Most didn't know why they were here. But none of them could deny it: something had drawn them together on this night, at this moment, to this place.

They walked toward suite **1108**.
