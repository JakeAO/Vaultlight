### The Cracker

<summary markdown="span">Heylorn Olindar receives a mysterious puzzle from an anonymous stranger.</summary>

<div class="details-prose" markdown="1">
The perpetual rain of Lake City's fall season hammered down as Heylorn Olindar stumbled out of The Penumbra—broke and in debt. Again. Kade Rowe, the Penumbra's public face for floor security, had gently but firmly shown him the door once he'd maxed out his credit. The rain soaked through his coat as he staggered back to the apartment.

Inside, the warmth hit him first. Then the hum.

Dozens of servers sang their electric chorus in his cramped studio. Banks of VCRs, BetaMax players, 8-track decks, cassette machines—tech of every forgotten era wired together in baroque tangles, all feeding into a single glowing display. This was his sanctuary.

With his wallet empty, Heylorn did what he always did: he slid into his chair and let his fingers find the keyboard. The green glow of the monitor would be his sun tonight, just like most nights.

Then came the ping.

An anonymous IP. Another one. That same IP had been pinging him for weeks with insistent invitations to a play-by-wire chess match. Tired of the noise, Heylorn finally relented and joined.

He nearly quit within minutes. Something was wrong with the board. Pawns on the first rank. Bishops on the same color. Impossible positions.

Then it clicked: this wasn't a game. This was a puzzle.

Heylorn shifted into cracker mode, fingers flying across the keyboard. An hour melted away. Two. Then, in a burst of clarity, he cracked it: **1108**.

But what did it mean? An address? A phone number? A room designation? The questions spiraled, unanswered. As dawn crept toward the windows, Heylorn finally admitted defeat for the night.

The puzzle could wait. It wasn't going anywhere.
