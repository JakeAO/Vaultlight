## The Premise

In a city perpetually shrouded in shadow, where neon signs flicker against the void and ancient powers stir beneath art deco facades, a crew of specialists has been assembled for an impossible job.

The **Vaultlight** is a repository of forbidden knowledge, a vault said to contain secrets that predate the city itself. Some say it holds the key to understanding the cosmic horror lurking at the edges of reality. Others claim it's a doorway to something that should never be opened.

Your crew has been hired—or perhaps compelled—to break in and retrieve an artifact from its depths. But in a city where nothing is as it seems, where every shadow conceals a watcher and every alliance is temporary, the real question isn't whether you can pull off the heist.

It's whether you'll survive what you find inside.

## Atmosphere

- **Noir Aesthetic:** Dark streets, morally grey characters, betrayal and redemption
- **Heist Structure:** Planning, execution, improvisation, consequences
- **Cosmic Horror:** Ancient mysteries, sanity-testing revelations, powers beyond comprehension
