## The Premise

You're not a hero. You're a specialist, a fixer, someone who knows how to work the angles in a world that doesn't give second chances. Maybe you're an ex-con, a hustler, a professional with burned bridges, or just someone who's had a run of bad luck. Whatever brought you here, you're broke, you're desperate, and you're out of options.

Then Mr. Nobody calls.

He's offering the job of a lifetime: break into [The Penumbra]({{ '/world/locations/the-penumbra/' | relative_url }})—an exclusive underground casino where politicians, crime lords, and the ultra-wealthy gather to make deals that never see daylight—and loot Vault 9. The pay? Life-changing money. Enough to fix everything.

But here's the question that should bother you more than it does: Why does this job pay so good?

## Atmosphere

- **Stylish Underworld:** A world of shadowy deals, neutral-ground casinos, and professionals who live by codes
- **Heist Planning:** Casing the target, recruiting specialists, contingency plans, and the perfect crime
- **Creeping Mystery:** Something feels off about this job. About The Penumbra. About Mr. Nobody himself.
- **Noir Atmosphere:** Cigarette smoke, rain-slicked streets, questions you shouldn't ask, and answers you won't like

## System

This campaign uses **FATE Condensed**, a streamlined narrative RPG system focusing on character aspects, skills, and collaborative storytelling. See the [Info section]({{ "/info/" | relative_url }}) for rules and resources.
